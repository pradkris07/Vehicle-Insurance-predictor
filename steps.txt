Steps to follow for the project:

1) Create a new repository in GitHub. Add Readme file, Licence and .gitignore file to it. Clone the respository to the pc.
2) Open the cloned folder in VS code thru powershell using command "code .".
3) Create project template by executing template.py file. This file creates the file structure required for the project.
4) Create setup.py file to access the local files as libraries to the project.
5) Create requirements.txt file to add all the required standard libraries to the project.
6) Run "uv init" to initialize the virtual environment.
7) Run "uv add -r requirements.txt" to add the dependencies to the virtual environment.
8) Run "uv pip instsll -e ." to add the local packages to the environment.
9) Create folder "notebook" >> Dataset added to notebook folder >>  create file "mongoDB_demo.ipynb" 
10) Push your data to mongoDB database from your python notebook.
11) Go to mongoDB Atlas >> Database >> browse collection >> see your data in key value format
12) Add logger and exception handling code block to the project.
13) Work on the dataset in a jupyter notebook. Do Exploratory Data Analysis on the data and come up with conclusions. 
14) We will be using Random Forest Classifier to do classification.
15) Now we will use demo.py for testing the code. 
16) Before we work on "Data Ingestion" component >> Declare variables within constants.__init__.py file >> 
    add code to configuration.mongo_db_connections.py file and define the func for mondodb connection >> 
    Inside "data_access" folder, add code to proj1_data that will use mongo_db_connections.py
    to connect with DB, fetch data in key-val format and transform that to df >>
    add code to entity.config_entity.py file till DataIngestionConfig class >>
    add code to entity.artifact_entity.py file till DataIngestionArtifact class >>
    add code to components.data_ingestion.py file >> add code to training pipeline >> 
    run demo.py (set mongodb connection url first, see next step)
17) Create a .env file and add the following line to it: 

	MONGODB_URL = "mongodb+srv://pradkris07:XsrQZnySfMvxe7sF@cluster0.f5f29yi.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0"
	
	This line will set the MongoDB url to point to our database. Also add load_dotenv() to demo.py to set the env. variable
18) Complete the work on utils.main_utils.py and config.schema.yaml file (add entire info about dataset for data validation step)
19) Now work on the "Data Validation" component the way we did in step 16 for Data Ingestion. (Workflow mentioned below)
20) Now work on the "Data Transformation" component the way we did in above step. (add estimator.py to entity folder)
21) Now work on the "Model Trainer" component the way we did in above step. (add class to estimator.py in entity folder)
22) Go to Google Cloud Console. Create a new Credentials of OAuth 2.0 Client IDs for Type "desktop". Dowload the JSON file and rename it credentials.json. Keep the 
    file in the same project folder. 
23) Now work on the "Model Pusher" component the way we did in above steps. 
24)

Steps to follow for the project:

1) Create a new repository in GitHub. Add Readme file, Licence and .gitignore file to it. Clone the respository to the pc.
2) Open the cloned folder in VS code thru powershell using command "code .".
3) Create project template by executing template.py file. This file creates the file structure required for the project.
4) Create setup.py file to access the local files as libraries to the project.
5) Create requirements.txt file to add all the required standard libraries to the project.
6) Run "uv init" to initialize the virtual environment.
7) Run "uv add -r requirement.txt" to add the dependencies to the virtual environment.
8) Run "uv pip instsll -e ." to add the local packages to the environment.
9) Create folder "notebook" >> Dataset added to notebook folder >>  create file "mongoDB_demo.ipynb" 
10) Push your data to mongoDB database from your python notebook.
11) Go to mongoDB Atlas >> Database >> browse collection >> see your data in key value format
12) Add logger and exception handling code block to the project.
13) Work on the dataset in a jupyter notebook. Do Exploratory Data Analysis on the data and come up with conclusions. 
14) We will be using Random Forest Classifier to do classification.

Steps to follow for the project:

1) Create a new repository in GitHub. Add Readme file, Licence and .gitignore file to it. Clone the respository to the pc.
2) Open the cloned folder in VS code thru powershell using command "code .".
3) Create project template by executing template.py file. This file creates the file structure required for the project.
4) Create setup.py file to access the local files as libraries to the project.
5) Create requirements.txt file to add all the required standard libraries to the project.
6) Run "uv init" to initialize the virtual environment.
7) Run "uv add -r requirements.txt" to add the dependencies to the virtual environment.
8) Run "uv pip instsll -e ." to add the local packages to the environment.
9) Create folder "notebook" >> Dataset added to notebook folder >>  create file "mongoDB_demo.ipynb" 
10) Push your data to mongoDB database from your python notebook.
11) Go to mongoDB Atlas >> Database >> browse collection >> see your data in key value format
12) Add logger and exception handling code block to the project.
13) Work on the dataset in a jupyter notebook. Do Exploratory Data Analysis on the data and come up with conclusions. 
14) We will be using Random Forest Classifier to do classification.
15) Now we will use demo.py for testing the code. 
16) Before we work on "Data Ingestion" component >> Declare variables within constants.__init__.py file >> 
    add code to configuration.mongo_db_connections.py file and define the func for mondodb connection >> 
    Inside "data_access" folder, add code to proj1_data that will use mongo_db_connections.py
    to connect with DB, fetch data in key-val format and transform that to df >>
    add code to entity.config_entity.py file till DataIngestionConfig class >>
    add code to entity.artifact_entity.py file till DataIngestionArtifact class >>
    add code to components.data_ingestion.py file >> add code to training pipeline >> 
    run demo.py (set mongodb connection url first, see next step)
17) Create a .env file and add the following line to it: 

	MONGODB_URL = "mongodb+srv://pradkris07:XsrQZnySfMvxe7sF@cluster0.f5f29yi.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0"
	
	This line will set the MongoDB url to point to our database. Also add load_dotenv() to demo.py to set the env. variable
18) Complete the work on utils.main_utils.py and config.schema.yaml file (add entire info about dataset for data validation step)
19) Now work on the "Data Validation" component the way we did in step 16 for Data Ingestion. (Workflow mentioned below)
20) Now work on the "Data Transformation" component the way we did in above step. (add estimator.py to entity folder)
21) Now work on the "Model Trainer" component the way we did in above step. (add class to estimator.py in entity folder)
22) This component will train using the train.csv file and the model is uploaded into the folder "RandomForstClassifier".
23) Now we will start our work on "Model Evaluation" and "Model Pusher" component. Mdel Evaluation verifies the F1 score of newly trained mmodel created
    by this run with model in the google drive if it is present. If the new model has better f1 score, it overwrites the model in the folder 
	"RandomForstClassifier".
24) Create the code structure of "Prediction Pipeline" and setup your app.py
25) Add "static" and "template" dir to the project. 

26) Getting started with CI-CD process:
      * Setup the dockerfile and .dockerignore file
      * Setup the .github\workflows dir and render.yaml file within. Also add render-run.yaml file for connecting to the render server.
	  * In the github actions, create a secret key to access render service.
27) Create a dockerfile to containerize the object. 
28) Add the updated code to github and push it so that CICD pipeline runs and the docker container is pushed to the render server. The deployment should
    start automatically in render.
29) Login to render server and go to workbench where all the active deployment will be visible. Click on the Vehicle Insurance Predictor deplpyment. Once the 
    details appear, the URL will be available. 
	https://vd-mlops-vehicle-insurance.onrender.com
30) You can enter any value in the form to check the prediction.
31) You will also have a training link if we need to update the model with new data.
